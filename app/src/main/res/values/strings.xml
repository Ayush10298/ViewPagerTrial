    <string name="hello_first_fragment">Hello first fragment      When you have an implementation of a PageTransformer, call setPageTransformer() with your implementation to apply your custom animations. For example, if you have a PageTransformer named ZoomOutPageTransformer, you can set your custom animations like this:     The position parameter indicates where a given page is located relative to the center of the screen. It is a dynamic property that changes as the user scrolls through the pages. When a page fills the screen, its position value is 0. When a page is drawn just off the right side of the screen, its position value is 1. If the user scrolls halfway between pages one and two, page one has a position of -0.5 and page two has a position of 0.5. Based on the position of the pages on the screen, you can create custom slide animations by setting page properties with methods such as setAlpha(), setTranslationX(), or setScaleY().    </string>
